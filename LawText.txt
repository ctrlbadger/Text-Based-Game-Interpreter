The ISPs or Internet Service Providers, who you pay for your internet, hold the data for one year. 
This means that security services can not find anything on your browser after one year. 
For you this means added costs to your Internet bill because your ISPs will need to finance the cost 
of these new data centres

You can't really stop people spying on you unless you are a 
Journalist or you know something that could be a threat to national security. 
You need to go through a court process involving the home security and a committee of judges.

Police and others can intercept and read communications 
but they can only do this when allowed by the Home Secretary. 
They're also allowed to interfere and hack computers. 
Companies are to assist the officially sanctioned hacking operations and your data 
that’s collected will eventually be broken down to see if there is any kind of signs of criminality or leads.
